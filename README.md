# Optimizing a Neural-Network for MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Dataset
An implementation of a neural-newtork for MNIST combined with early stopping and dropouts.

# Architecture of the NN
The model is a 3 layer neural network with the followoing architecture:
  + Input layer : 784 nodes (MNIST images size)
  +  First layer of 1024 nodes
  +  Second layer of 243 nodes
  +  Output layer of 10 nodes, one for each digit
